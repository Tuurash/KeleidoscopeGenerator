### TODO
Couple things...

- [X] - Can we use more readable variables?Initially I didn't know what sx, sy, sw, sh , tw, th is , but I can sort of deduce what they mean, however, let's use long variable names so it is easier to read if possible.

- [X] - Comments is always welcome, and I did mention, Comments aren't compiled to JS i believe, so they just help in development for the typescript with understanding of the code and extending.

- [X] - We mentioned about the square and whether we would flip on horizontal squares being controlled via a boolean on the square class, where about is this toggle.

- [X] - Also I mentioned about the flipping when doing the verticals, for the squares.  Again this should be controlled via a boolean on the square class.

- [X] - I believe we should also do flipping on the triangle as well on the horizontals and verticals, but again these should be controlled via two booleans that indicate whether to flip or not. 

- [X] - Resizable Selectors

###### If the V1 zip with the non tidyup has these comments I do appologise as I haven't checked, and if so, maybe better to use that possibly?
